Dear John,

nice to hear about new Connect discounting program. 

So I'm wondering if the firm will be able to provide the following:

120x120 flash banner at the top of the main page for 14-18 years male visitors appearing between 12am-18pm
120x60 static banner at the top of the main page targeting 12-22 years female visitors appearing somewhere around 10am-18pm

It's planned to start somewhere in Jan-2011. 


Thank you very much.

Cheers,
George

P.S. How about football on this weekend? - Saymon said he's available
